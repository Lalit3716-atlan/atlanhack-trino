# Atlan PostgreSQL App Setup

This guide automatically detects your operating system and provides the appropriate setup instructions to get the Atlan PostgreSQL App running.

## Automatic OS Detection

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Detect operating system
detect_os() {
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin*)
      echo "Detected macOS"
      open docs/setup/MAC.md
      ;;
    Linux*)
      echo "Detected Linux"
      if command -v xdg-open > /dev/null; then
        xdg-open docs/setup/LINUX.md
      else
        echo "Please open docs/setup/LINUX.md in your browser or text editor"
      fi
      ;;
    CYGWIN*|MINGW*|MSYS*)
      echo "Detected Windows"
      start docs/setup/WINDOWS.md
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unknown operating system"
      echo "Please manually open one of the following setup guides:"
      echo "- docs/setup/MAC.md (for macOS)"
      echo "- docs/setup/LINUX.md (for Linux)"
      echo "- docs/setup/WINDOWS.md (for Windows)"
      ;;
  esac
}

# Run the detection
detect_os
```

## Guidelines

- When asked to setup the environment, do not ask the user to read the instructions and do it. YOU DO IT INSTEAD.
- Always check what part of the setup step is already done (example: if the required version of python already exists, inform and proceed. If not, proceed with installing it)


## Manual Selection

If the automatic detection doesn't work, please open the appropriate guide based on your operating system:

- [MAC.md](mdc:docs/setup/MAC.md)
- [LINUX.md](mdc:docs/setup/LINUX.md)
- [WINDOWS.md](mdc:docs/setup/WINDOWS.md)

## Setup Overview

The Atlan PostgreSQL App requires the following components regardless of operating system:

1. Python 3.11.10
2. Poetry 1.8.5
3. Temporal CLI
4. DAPR CLI 1.14.1
5. Project dependencies

The OS-specific guides provide detailed instructions for installing these components and running the application.
